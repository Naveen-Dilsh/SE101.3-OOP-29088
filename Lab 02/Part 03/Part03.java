Part 03
1. Real-world objects contain state and behavior.
2. A software object's state is stored in instance variables (data members).
3. A software object's behavior is exposed through methods (member functions).
4. Hiding internal data from the outside world, and accessing it only through publicly exposed
methods is known as data encapsulation.
5. A blueprint for a software object is called a class.
